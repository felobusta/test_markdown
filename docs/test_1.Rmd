## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(topicmodels)
library(tm)
library(stringr)
library(ldatuning)
library(rlist)
library(stm)

page<- (1:5)

urls <- list()


for (i in 1:length(page)) { 
  url<- paste0("https://www.latercera.com/etiqueta/coronavirus/page/",page[i])
  urls[[i]] <- url
}
urls

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
length(urls)

alfa<- list()

for (j in seq_along(urls)) {
  try({ #we use try because sometimes our connection may not be the best, so we want the code to skips some links when thats the case
  alfa[[j]]<- urls[[j]]%>%
    session()%>%
    #you can check the xpath by inspecting the webpage in chrome

    html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div/div/div/main/section/div/article/div/div/h3/a")%>%
    html_attr('href')
    #we add a print to get the nomber of each page in case there is some error (404 error) or problem with our connection
  print(j)
  })
}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r pressure 2}
alfa[[1]]
```
