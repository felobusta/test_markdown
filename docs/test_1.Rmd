## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(topicmodels)
library(tm)
library(stringr)
library(ldatuning)
library(rlist)
library(stm)

page<- (1:5)

urls <- list()


for (i in 1:length(page)) { 
  url<- paste0("https://www.latercera.com/etiqueta/coronavirus/page/",page[i])
  urls[[i]] <- url
}
urls

```

## Including Plots - WTF

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}

length(urls)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
